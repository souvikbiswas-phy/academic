I am a fifth year PhD candidate in the department of [Applied Physics](https://aph.caltech.edu) at [Caltech](https://www.caltech.edu) (2017 onwards), working in [Prof. Harry A. Atwater](https://daedalus.caltech.edu)'s group. Broadly, my academic interests lie at the intersection of condensend matter physics, optics and electrical engineering. More specifically, my research is focused on strong light-matter interaction in van der Waals layered materials for fundamental optical spectroscopy and active nanophotonics.  

Prior to joining Caltech, I graduated from [Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Kharagpur](http://iitkgp.ac.in) with a B.Sc. and M.Sc in Physics (2012-2017). I was advised by [Prof. Samit K. Ray](https://microsckgp.wixsite.com/skray-research-group) for my thesis, where I worked on opto-electronics of low-dimensional colloidal systems.

### A Jekyll theme for academia

![Academic Screenshot](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/LeNPaul/academic/gh-pages/screenshot.png)

A Jekyll theme designed for academia, although you can use it for almost any other purpose as well:

* Showcase your research interests, publications, your curriculum vitae, the people in your research group, and your contact information.

* Manage courses that you are teaching.

* Provide updates to your students and faulty.

For a guide on how to deploy a Jekyll site using GitHub Pages, please check out [this article](https://paulle.ca/jekyll-tutorials/deploy-jekyll-site-github-pages).

If you like my work then please consider supporting me with [Ko-fi](https://ko-fi.com/paulle).

## Installation

### Ruby Gem Method

Add this line to your Jekyll site's `Gemfile`:

```ruby
gem "academic-jekyll-theme"
```

And add this line to your Jekyll site's `_config.yml`:

```yaml
theme: academic-jekyll-theme
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install academic-jekyll-theme

## Usage

### Layouts

The following sections describe usage instructions for this Jekyll theme,including available layouts, includes, sass and/or assets.

#### Home

The `_layouts/home.html` layout defines the home page for this theme. An introduction to your research group or to yourself can be provided, along with a list of featured publications. There is also a section for providing any updates through posts placed in the `_posts` directory.

#### People

The `_layouts/people.html` layout can be used to showcase and describe people in your research group. People are defined in the `_data/settings.yml` file, and markdown pages for each person with the `_layouts/page.html` layout can be placed in the `people` directory.

#### Publications

Direct links to the paper can be used, or a PDF copy of the paper can be served. Publications are defined in the `_data/publications.yml` file, and any PDF files that are served can be placed in the `publications` directory.

#### Courses

The `_layouts/courses.html` layout can be used to showcase courses that were taught in the past or are currently being taught. Courses are defined in the `_data/settings.yml` file, and markdown pages for each course with the `_layouts/page.html` layout can be placed in the `courses` directory. Related course material, such as PDF files, can also be placed in the `courses` directory in a subdirectory with the same name as the corresponding course.

#### CV

The `_layouts/cv.html` layout can be used to showcase a curriculum vitae. The sections of the cv are defined in the `_data/cv` directory, where each section has its own `<section>.yml` file.

#### Contact

The `_layouts/contact.html` layout can be used to provide contact information for the research group or the people that lead the research group. Contact information is defined in the `_data/settings.yml` file.
